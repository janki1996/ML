# Height Estimation in video surveillance - Machine Learning

Height Estimation using Machine learning algorithms in Open CV python. 

Abstract <br/>

This paper presents a simple method for estimating human height in video surveillance. Most cameras for video surveillance are installed in high positions at a slightly tilted angle, it is possible to retain human height using the tilt angle. Certain parameters such as reference height, detected pixel height and display resolution are taken into account. These parameters are calculated using a visual perception based formula proposed in the paper. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect human height with the absolute error of 7 cm from ground.
